# About

I’m **Glaucia Possas da Motta** (Nova SBE). My research focuses on **patient navigation**, **value-based health care**, and **oncology outcomes**.

## Current research
**We Guide (Patient Navigation RCT, Portugal)**  
Randomized trial evaluating the impact of patient navigators on QoL, clinical outcomes, and costs.

- Outcomes: QLQ-C30 improvements in emotional/cognitive functioning; reduced insomnia/constipation.
- Efficiency: Shorter treatment duration; fewer incomplete visits; lower LOS.
- Economics: Savings exceed direct navigator cost (2022 €).
- Status: Manuscript submitted to *Value in Health*.
